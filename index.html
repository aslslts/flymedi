                ’ history is not as new as it seems. First attempts at plastic
                and cosmetic surgery predate many other branches of medicine.
                Egyptian and Roman plastic surgeons, if we may call them by this
                term, focused mostly on the reconstruction of noses and other
                body parts which sustained some damage.</span

              <span style="font-size: 14px">
                Ancient texts dated to roughly 2500 to 3000 BCE have
                descriptions of broken noses and their repair. Then, there was
                the fall of Rome and the Middle Ages, during which the authority
                of the Catholic Church prevented further developments in
                aesthetic surgery.

                The lack of anesthesia meant much pain in attempts to perform
                plastic surgery procedures, rather than the lack of
                disinfection, which caused a high risk of postoperative
                infection. The awaited change was brought by the dawn of both
                anesthesia and modern disinfection; however, it was not until
                World War that plastic surgery procedures became a part of the
                medical mainstream.

                The image of plastic surgery clinics has changed as plastic
                surgery procedures gain popularity over the years. While it is
                an object of interest for middle-aged women who try to keep
                their youth and fight against aging, nowadays, aesthetic surgery

                As an example, liposuction is a very effective way of fighting
                stubborn fat tissue accumulating in the lower abdomen and is
                often impossible to be removed through traditional ways such as
                workouts and a regular diet. Even nose jobs become more and more
                popular among men who do not like the shape of their noses.

                Breast augmentation (boob job) which was treated as a synonym

                smaller size.

                Recent developments and new technology used have significantly
                reduced the amount of pain experienced both during, before, and
                after surgery. On top of that, as in any surgical procedure,
                some amount of discomfort is common and usual.

              <span style="font-size: 14px">
                There are many reasons why people decide on plastic surgery. The
                predominant one throughout the ages was using aesthetic surgery
                for the reconstruction of damaged noses, ears, or faces. War
                veterans or gladiators wanted to have their faces corrected by
                the first plastic surgeons.

            <p>
              <span style="font-size: 14px">
                However, there is also a second branch – cosmetic surgery for
                aesthetic reasons. Some people want to look younger and fresher
                as they feel inside. Others try to change a feature they've
                never liked or internalized. The decision of cosmetic plastic
                surgery is very personal rather than -usually- medical.

            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-size: 14px">
                One of the important factors is to set realistic expectations.
                Because plastic surgeries may change appearance, and improve
                self-esteem but may not solve problems or change lives.
