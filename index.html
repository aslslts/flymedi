                Egyptian and Roman plastic surgeons, if we may call them by this
                term, focused mostly on the reconstruction of noses and other
                body parts which sustained some damage.</span

                Ancient texts dated to roughly 2500 to 3000 BCE have
                descriptions of broken noses and their repair. Then, there was
                the fall of Rome and the Middle Ages, during which the authority
                of the Catholic Church prevented further developments in
                aesthetic surgery.

                The lack of anesthesia meant much pain in attempts to perform
                plastic surgery procedures, rather than the lack of
                disinfection, which caused a high risk of postoperative
                infection. The awaited change was brought by the dawn of both
                anesthesia and modern disinfection; however, it was not until
                World War that plastic surgery procedures became a part of the
                medical mainstream.

                One of the important factors is to set realistic expectations.

                self-esteem but may not solve problems or change lives.

                Plastic and cosmetic surgeries became a driving power behind the
                development of medical tourism in the world. Getting plastic

                The cost of plastic surgery at home can be several times higher
                than that of plastic surgery abroad. At the same time, you don't
                have to worry about quality and results, as foreign cosmetic
                clinics are often well-equipped and have good staff, helping

                  Plastic surgery in India is one of the best medical tourism
                  options, especially due to the significant difference in the
